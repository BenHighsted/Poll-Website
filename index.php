/**
 * 
 * Thinking creating a Poll website could be a good 'first project back'.
 * Would be a good one to use version control with, and make it well documented.
 * 
 * As I have been working with similar technologies at my internship, should be pretty
 * easy to just apply what I have been doing to a different project.
 * 
 * Could attempt to make it similar to stockpoll (or whatever its called)
 * but have it so it can display the data in all different formats (like pi charts and such)
 * 
 * Will need to make sure I .gitignore the connect.php file once I have created it.
